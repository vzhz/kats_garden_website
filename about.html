        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Katy's Garden is a family adventure, lead by the intrepid Katy, who has been growing things every since she was a child, always with the insistence that every plant that she cared for be grown the natural way, without anything Mother Nature wouldn't give it. Her insistence on using sustainable methods brought her and her family to begin keeping bees and chickens nearly 30 years ago, and they are now throughly in love with the little creatures. They treat both the same way they treat their plants - the bees live a pecticide-free, insecticide-free existence on land that has been planted with flowers with them in mind. The chickens roam around being chickens, rooting around for bugs and generally acting like they own everything they can see. </p>
